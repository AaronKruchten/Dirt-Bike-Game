To run the game first unzip the folder ands run the dirtbikegame.py file as you would run any other 
pygame file. Do not move the dirtbikegame.py file to a folder separate from the levels and other python files.
If you do this the game will likely not start and you will not be able to load in levels. 

Additionally, you must install pygame in order for the game to run properly. Installation of pygame can 
be completed by first downloading the relevenant file from http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml and then following
the installation guide which can be found at the following link. https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted#Installing%20From%20Source

Also, for windows users I found the following link very helpful for installing pygame

Dirtbikegame.py is a fast paced racing game similar to Max Dirt Bike or Winter racing.
Max Dirt Bike: http://www.maxdirtbike.org/
Winter Racing: http://www.addictinggames.com/car-games/winter-racing-game.jsp

The player controls a black dirt biker and races the red dirtbiker to the end of the game. The player wins
if his backwheel crosses the finish line before the opposing player (the red dirtbiker). The race is made
more challenging by obstacles that the player has to overcome on the race to the end of the level. In order
to get by these obstacles the player must use the left and right arrow keys to rotate his biker left and right
and the player must use the up and down arrow keys to accelerate and decelerate. 

Additionally, the game comes with a level editor. players can create a level anywhere from 1/5th the size of
a randomly generated level to 20 times the size of the regular randomly generated level. Players can then 
save their level and load it back up and play it at anytime they want.
