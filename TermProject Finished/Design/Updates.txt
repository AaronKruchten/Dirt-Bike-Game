I have not made any direct changes to any of the documents I submitted at the last tp besides the code. 

In the code I have finished up the game implemetning a few other obstacles than what I had previously.
Additonally, I have mostly finished the menu screen and the user interface allowing a player to easily
navigate their way through my game. Lastly, I have implemented a level editor that allows a user to make
their own custom level and save it then load it back and play it again. These files are included in the 
submission and are all the files with the name level in them that have a filetype of just file.
